# PD estimation tool

Probabilty of Default (PD) tool is based on Markov-chain transitions from one state to another for probabilty to arrive at terminal state.
This technique is used widely in banking as part of A-IRB methods to calculate reserves (loan loss provisioning). 

The app was built during my time at EY (Ernst & Young) in Prague, Czech Republic and reflects methodolgy used for various analyses 
as well as sold to clients.
The code hasn't been modified for quite some time and was optimized for early version of shiny library (0.50 if not mistaken) with Bootstrap 2 styles.

Working version is here: https://holek10.shinyapps.io/PD_estimation_tool/
